# Utils

This folder contains some utilities to help you with the benchmarks, including:

- `simplift-dataset.py`: A script to generate a simplified (smaller) dataset from the original dataset. Use this when you think the benchmark program spends too much time on loading the dataset.
- `profile-db-inspector.py`: A script for inspecting & visualizing the profile database generated by gen_profile_db.py.
