# Build the docker image

To build the docker image, you need to complete the following steps:

- `cd` into the root directory of the project and build the image with `docker build -t fastserve .` Do not
forget to type the dot at the end of the command.
- We recommend Chinese users to set up a proxy before building to avoid slow download speed.
